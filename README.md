# JuniorDev.io website

https://juniordev.io

JuniorDev.io is a sign up page where users can subscribe to our newletters and give us more information about whether they're a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer, and which state they live in.

PR's are welcome! So feel free to fork the repo above and get coding!

:tada:  **Thanks to all who contributed at JuniorDev Hacktoberfest 2018 to make this site even more awesome!**  :tada:
